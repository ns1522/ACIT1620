                <h2>About Dreams</h2>
                <p>Dreams are a series of (<em>thoughts, images, and sensations</em>) that occur in the mind during sleep.
                They are often vivid and can feel real, but they are shaped by our subconscious mind, blending memories, 
                emotions, and imagination. Dreams can be mysterious and fascinating, with some reflecting daily experiences,
                while others delve into abstract and symbolic realms. Scientists believe that dreams play a role in processing
                emotions, consolidating memories, and fostering creativity. Whether vivid or fleeting, dreams remain a
                captivating part of the human experience.</p>
